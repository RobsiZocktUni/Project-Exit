# Project Exit Demo    
  
## Starting Animation  
The game begins with the character waking up in a dimly lit room. They approach the door and attempt to open it, only to find it locked.  
Frustrated, they turn around to survey the room, sparking the beginning of the gameplay.    
  
### Initial Exploration  
- The room is shrouded in darkness, with only faint moonlight streaming in from the window, illuminating parts of the space.  
- The player begins to search the room, eventually discovering a box of matches on the nightstand to the right of the bed.  
The matches are subtly highlighted by the moonlight.  
- Using the matches, the player lights the candles on the nightstand, brightening the room and revealing its contents.
  
#### Interactive Environment  
- The player can interact with all doors and drawers, encouraging thorough exploration.  
- Once the room is illuminated, key puzzles and items become visible, setting the stage for progression.  
  
##### Key Puzzles
1. Sliding Puzzle:
- Located on the left nightstand, the sliding puzzle contains the key to the dollhouse.  
- The player must solve the puzzle to retrieve the key.  

2. Dollhouse Puzzle
- The dollhouse sits in a corner of the room. Using the key from the sliding puzzle, the player can unlock it.  
- Inside the dollhouse, the player finds mannequins that need to be dressed appropriately based on the weather depicted in a calendar  
found in the room.  
- The mannequins require four outfits:
-> Summer dress  
-> Winter dress  
-> Raincoat  
-> Grief dress   
- The calendar provides subtle clues about each outfit, encouraging observation and logical deduction.  
- Solving this puzzle reveals the key to the roomâ€™s main door.  

###### Final Sequence  
- The player uses the key to unlock the main door and steps into an ominously dark room.

- Upon interacting with the doll, an eerie laugh echoes through the space.  
- The screen fades to black as the sound lingers, marking the end of the demo.
